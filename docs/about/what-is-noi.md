title: What is NOI Synth

NOI is a open-source open-hardware personal portable synthesizer.

## Documentation status

There is no intention to build a user manual for the project right now. We are currently focusing on building a [internal documentation](project-docs/overview.md) for our purposes. The documentation is of course public and will be available together with user manual.

### Proposed structure

The documentation structure could look like this:

- About
    - What is NOI?
    - Technical specifications
    - Getting started
- Building your NOI
    - What you'll need
    - Constructing the hardware
    - Building the case
    - Constructing the software
    - Finishing
- Using your NOI
    - Quick tutorial
    - Create your first track
    - All features
- Project Documentation
    - Parts of the NOI
    - ...
